FlexCCT: Software for Continous Cultural Consensus Theory

The GITHub repository contains five files.

i) FlexCCTv2.0PCStandard.txt - Contains a link to the full software package, including MATLAB runtime files.  If you already have the MATLAB runtime files installed or you have access to the web when installing the software, then you should utilize the web version, as it only requires a 4MB download rather than a 500MB download.
Compatible with Windows versions 7SP1, 8, 8.1, 10, Server 2008SP2, Server 2008R2SP1, Server 2012

ii) FlexCCTv2.0XOSMacStandard.txt - Contains a link to the full software package, including MATLAB runtime files.  If you already have the MATLAB runtime files installed then you should utilize the web version, as it only requires a 4MB download rather than a 500MB download.
Compatible with Mac OS 10.10 (Yosemite), 10.11 (El Capitan)

iii) FlexCCT2.0Source.zip - The cut of the source files for FlexCCTv2.0

iv) FlexCCTv2.0PCWeb.exe - Contains the software installer for PC.  This version does not include the required MATLAB runtime files.  If the MATLAB runtime files are not present then the installer will download these files from the web.
Compatible with Windows versions 7SP1, 8, 8.1, 10, Server 2008SP2, Server 2008R2SP1, Server 2012

v) FlexCCTv2.0XOSMacWeb.app.zip - Contains the software installer for the Apple Mac.  This version does not include the required MATLAB runtime files.  If the MATLAB runtime files are not present then the installer should download these files from the web. We have found that this process does not always work, so users may wish to install the full standalone package during the initial installation.
Compatible with Mac OS 10.10 (Yosemite), 10.11 (El Capitan)

vi) FlexCCTHelpFilev2P00.pdf - The help file for FlexCCT.  This is also included in all of the installation packages.
